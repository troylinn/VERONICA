# Summary

SPAC - funding approach to adopt Blockchain in real economy.

![SPAC Process Overview](https://github.com/adbrome/spac/blob/master/spec/images/SPACOverview.png)

Concept is based on [investment funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special-purpose_acquisition_company)
structuring that allows public investors to invest in private equity transactions
executed by merging with or acquiring a company with the proceeds of fund’s initial 
public offering. Modifications to initial SPAC structure accounts for cryptocurrency 
environment.

Proposed structure incentivizes the following outcomes:
* To fund adoption of blockchain in certain niche through acquisition of the existing
market player(s)
* To grow value of the acquired assets via use of proceeds and capturing blockchain-related
synergies adopted by acquired player
* To execute value added strategy by professional and reputable Founding team
* To align founding team rewards and token buyers’ interests

# How SPAC works?

![SPAC: ICO and M&A execution process](https://github.com/adbrome/spac/blob/master/spec/images/ExecutionProcess.png)

* Foundation issues tokens
* Token buyers bet on Founders’s ability to succeed in adoption of blockchain in the
  existing business (vs. typical ICO when founders usually need to develop technology
  and gain market dominant position to impact the industry)
* At least 95% of ICO proceeds are held in Escrow to be used at a later date for the
  merger or acquisition
* Up to 5% is allocated for Administrative expenses for office, lawyers, due diligence, etc.
* In addition to share ownership each token allows token holder to buy [one more] token
  in future at fixed price (Warrant)
* Founders must sign letter of intent for merger or acquisition within [6 - 12] months
  of the ICO to initiate funds release from escrow
* Otherwise it will be forced to dissolve and return funds held in the escrow to token
  holders
* If a letter of intent is signed within [6 - 12] months, funds will be allocated from
  escrow to Founders
* Target of the acquisition must have fair market value equal to at least 80% of ICO's
  funds raised at the time of acquisition
* Executed business combination require full disclosure of the target business, including
  complete audited financials, and terms of the proposed business combination

# Founders incentives

* Founders team shall include members with operating, private equity and M&A experience
  with demonstrated ability to create value for shareholders
* **NO salaries, finder's fees or other cash compensation** are paid to Founders prior to
  the business combination
* Founders do not participate in liquidating distribution if they fail to propose a successful
  business combination
* Founders receive 20% of SPAC tokens if ICO is conducted, exclusive of the value of the warrants
* Founders' tokens are held in escrow for [1 – 3 years]
* Founders can participate in ICO for up to 5% of total funding [and such investment won't be 
  returned in case of Foundation liquidation]
* Founders are prohibited from business combination with any entity which is affiliated with 
  an insider without token holders approval (forced by Voting event)
* Founders don't participate in liquidation proceeds in case Foundation is dissolved

# SPAC pros & cons

### Advantages:

* No management fees or cash compensation is paid to Founders
  > Investors in funds typically pay 2% annual management fees irrespective of the amount of
  > capital actually invested by the PE fund. Over the life of the PE fund, this can amount 
  > to 14%. Additionally, 20% of the realized profits are paid as "management carry" to the PE 
  > fund to incentivize them to produce high returns.
* Founders can put their own funds at risk until an initial business combination is closed
  > Founders can buy up to 5% of ICO tokens. If a business combination is effected then the SPAC 
  > Management Team receives 20% of tokens as compensation (in addition to tokens bought at ICO).
  > These tokens are locked up for [2-3 years] to ensure that Founders are focused on long-term
  > value creation. Half of these shares can be sold before the lock-up deadline if the token 
  > price rises by 25% over the initial placement price.
* Investors hold liquid tokens
  > All ICO participants can sell their tokens if they are not interested in exposure to the
  > acquired entity. Founders undergo scrutiny as part of the ICO process with disclosures around
  > their career history and any criminal or civil legal issues. They are also subject to information
  > disclosure obligations as per applicable Exchange regulations.
* Transparency of team/investments
  > Composition of execution team who will execute operational supervision, M&A and exit strategy
  > is transparent from the beginning. SPAC Founders will take seats on the board of directors of 
  > the acquired assets and continue to add value as advisors.
* Foundation has growth capital in place
  > Foundation has significant resources to impact blockchain adoption in the industry via 
  > acquired assets. Long term goal of such acquisition is to increase assets value from 
  > blockchain adoption.
* SPACs provide incentives for the management team to searches for best target to acquire
* SPAC’s liquidity attracts more investors as they are offered in the open market

### Disadvantages

Other than the risks normally associated with ICOs, SPACs’ public shareholders' risks may 
include:

* Limited liquidity of their tokens until the close of the initial business combination. 
  After Foundation has acquired an operating company, the liquidity of tokens is similar 
  to other tokens of similar size
* Low visibility on future acquisition(s) at the time of SPAC offering
* Dilution due to founder shares up to 20%
* Potential for uncertainty associated with regulation of merger/acquisition proxy process
